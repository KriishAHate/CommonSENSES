# Goal: Assess consistency and synchronization between two identical sound sensors by diagnosing and correcting timestamp mismatches.

# Summary of setup:
# - Two identical sound sensors connected to the same PCB via ADS1115.
# - Constant sound played for 2 minutes.
# - Data format: timestamp, sensor1, sensor2.
# - ADC readings converted to voltage: (ADC / 32768) * 6.144.
# - Data filtered to include only timestamps ≤ 147019 ms.

# Observed issue:
# - Grid-like scatter instead of a diagonal cluster, indicating potential timestamp misalignment.

# Suspected cause:
# - Timestamp discrepancies due to back-to-back reading delays.

# Solution:
# - Bin data in 100 ms intervals to align sensor readings.

# Steps:
# 1. Load and filter data.
# 2. Convert ADC values to voltage.
# 3. Create 100 ms bins: floor(timestamp / 100) * 100.
# 4. For each bin, calculate the mean voltage for sensor1 and sensor2.
# 5. Use the first timestamp in each bin as the representative time.

# Visualization:
# - Plot binned sensor1 vs sensor2 voltages.
# - Expect points to cluster more clearly along the diagonal.

# Quantify sensor agreement:
# - Calculate mean and standard deviation of voltage differences.
# - Compute Pearson correlation coefficient between the sensors.

# Create a new column grouping timestamps into 100 ms bins
# --------------------------------------------------------
# This line divides each timestamp (in milliseconds) by 100 and uses floor()
# to round down to the nearest whole number. This groups timestamps into
# 100 ms time intervals (e.g., 0–99 ms becomes bin 0, 100–199 ms becomes bin 1, etc.)

# Aggregate: average voltages in each 100 ms bin
# ----------------------------------------------
# This block groups the filtered data by time_bin and calculates the average
# voltage from Sensor 1 and Sensor 2 for each time bin.

avg_data <- filtered_data %>%

  # Group the data by 100 ms bins created above
  # Each group contains all rows where the timestamp falls
  # within the same 100 ms window

# You can later reconstruct actual time (e.g., bin 0 = 0 ms, bin 1 = 100 ms, etc.)
# by multiplying 'time_bin' by 100.
