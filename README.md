## Repository Structure

### `Sensor data sheets/`
Contains datasheets and documentation for the sensors used in the system. Useful for understanding specifications, calibration procedures, and interfacing details.

### `Box deployment pictures/`
Photographic documentation from field deployments of the sensor box, capturing real-world setups, environments, and enclosures used.

### `Sound sensor test 03162025/`, `03192025/`, `10292024/`
Date-stamped folders containing raw data, observations, and notes from individual sound sensor test sessions.

### `sound sensor test experimental plan/`
Contains planning documents outlining the objectives, variables, and methodology for upcoming or completed sensor tests.
