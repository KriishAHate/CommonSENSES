# Sensor Box Development Documentation

This repository contains the complete documentation and associated files for the development and deployment of the custom-built sensor box used in this project. The repository is organized into folders that represent key components of the development process ‚Äî from mechanical and electrical design to deployment and production workflows.

## üìÅ Folder Structure

- **BOM and Production hours estimate**  
  Contains the Bill of Materials (BOM) and time estimates for assembling the sensor box. Useful for cost tracking and planning production timelines.

- **Sensor Box Production Checklists**  
  Includes finalized production and assembly checklists to ensure quality and consistency during the build process.

- **Sensor Box deployment pictures**  
  Deployment images contributed by team members, documenting initial field use and installation of the sensor box.

- **Sensor data sheets**  
  Technical data sheets for all sensors integrated into the box, including electrical specifications and operational ranges.

- **Sound sensor tests**  
  Results and notes from early testing of the sound sensor module, including folder reorganization and analysis history.

## üìå Purpose

This repository serves as a centralized, version-controlled archive of the sensor box project ‚Äî enabling smooth collaboration, traceability, and reproducibility for future iterations or similar builds.
